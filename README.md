# RESUME BUILDER APPLICATION

## Introduction
Job-seekers always face a challenge of creating a simple resume just to meet the requirements of a specific job interview. This inspired me to come up with a simple app to help create resumes just to meet the purpose at hand.

## Project Description
This is a React project to assist job-seekers build a simple, yet fancy portfolio with just the main details of a resume in a few minutes. With a few inputs, you'll have your job-specific resume.

## MVP
1. 4 tabs on the navigation bar
2. SignIn page
3. Home page where already created resume will show on search
4. Create resume page that allows user create their resume
5. SignOut page

## User stories
1. As a user I should be able to sign in to the application, and be redirected to the home page.
2. As a user I should be able to search my resume in home page. If I already craeted one, I should see it displayed on the home page. Otherwise, I should be notified to create one first.
3. As a user, I should be able to create my resume on the Create Resume page.
4. As a user, I should be able sign out of the application. However, I should first be prompted to confirm my logging out.

## Project Guide
### 1. Sign in
Enter your username and password and click signin. You'll be redirected to home page.

### 2. Search resume
On the home page, you can search for already created resumes using the name of the user. The resume matching the name will be displayed. 
*Note: You should not worry about letter case or space between the names. As long as your input matches some name, you'll have your resume displayed.*

### 3. Create resume
On the Create Resume page, you should be able to provide values for the different fields of the resume. On submit, you should be notified that your resume was created successfully and be redirected to the home page. Here, you can now search for your resume and have it displayed.

### 4. Sign out
When you click the sign out tab, you will be prompted to confirm that you really want to sign out. If you want to sign out, click 'YES, sign out' button, which will redirect you to the sign in page. Otherwise, click 'Cancel' to remain in the app; you'll be redirected to the home page.

## Conclusion
This is just a simple application to assist create basic resume. Overtime, I will be adding more functionalities to it, for example adding more skills in a user friendly way.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
